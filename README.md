# Diffraction-in-Python-Fourier-Transform-
Diffraction of Gaussian function in python using fft and fourier transform of images .
Run fft_double_slit.py to see the double slit diffraction pattern.
Run FourierTranformation_yt.ipy to see dft and fft of functions and images separately.
Run Optics in Python.ipy to see the diffraction pattern for single , double and multiple no. of slits using Fraunhofer Diffraction.
In Letter_recognization(folder) , python file to determine fourier transform of various alphabets is given .
